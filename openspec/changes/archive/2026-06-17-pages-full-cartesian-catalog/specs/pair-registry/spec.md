## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Outcome enumeration from data columns

The pair registry SHALL enumerate outcome variables from prepared city and ZIP DataFrames by matching known column patterns (`{dr_type}_{phase}_total`, `net_{phase}`, `net_MF_{phase}`, income-tier `*_CO` columns, etc.) against columns that exist in the frame at build time.

#### Scenario: Phase expansion beyond CO

- **WHEN** `df_final` contains `DB_BP_total` and the registry runs for city geography
- **THEN** the registry includes outcome `DB_BP_total` (or normalized `y_col` key) paired with every applicable predictor

#### Scenario: Missing column skipped

- **WHEN** an outcome pattern has no matching column in the DataFrame
- **THEN** the registry does not emit pairs for that outcome

### Requirement: Predictor enumeration from PREDICTOR_META

The pair registry SHALL enumerate predictors from `PREDICTOR_META` keys filtered by `geo_applicability` (`city`, `zip`, or `both`) for each geography.

#### Scenario: ZIP income delta included

- **WHEN** geography is `zip` and `income_delta_pct_change` has `geo_applicability: both`
- **THEN** the registry includes pairs with `x_col: income_delta_pct_change`

### Requirement: Full Cartesian product

The pair registry SHALL return the Cartesian product of (valid outcomes × valid predictors × robustness variants) for each geography, excluding combinations where data masks yield fewer than the minimum jurisdiction count.

#### Scenario: Robustness on MFH streams only

- **WHEN** outcome stream is not multifamily-related
- **THEN** the registry emits only the `none` robustness variant for that outcome

### Requirement: Stable pair identity

Each emitted pair SHALL expose `geography`, `y_col`, `x_col`, `robustness`, and optional metadata (`dr_type`, `cat_suffix`, `var_suffix`) for catalog key construction.

#### Scenario: Pair record shape

- **WHEN** the registry yields a city pair for `TOTAL_CO_total` × `zori_pct_change`
- **THEN** the record includes `geography: city`, `y_col`, `x_col: zori_pct_change`, `robustness: none`
